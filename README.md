To Install JDK: https://ninite.com/  
  
  
When you have Coffeemud all installed, you can open the folder where  
you downloaded/unzipped it and make a shortcut for mud.bat  
and then you can change the name of the shortcut to Coffeemud,  
and change the shortcut's icon, and click that to start your server,    
( it will open the command prompt and begin loading it there )  


When you want to connect to your mud, open your mud client  
(zmud, mush, mudlet, etc) and go to host: 127.0.0.1 Port 5555.  
(This will let you play the game on your home computer)  


If you wish to modify the mud, open your browser ( firefox, chrome, opera, etc),    
and navigate to the admin web site on port 27777.  
i.e. (http://localhost:27777/), this will open the MudGrinder interface.  
To see your mud's public webpage, you can use ports 80 or 27744 ( public),  
i.e. (http://localhost:27744/)
