To Install JDK: https://ninite.com/  
  
  
When you have it all installed, you can open the folder where  
you downloaded/unzipped it and make a shortcut for mud.bat  
and then you can change the name of the shortcut to Coffeemud,  
and change the shortcut's icon, and click that to start your server.

When you want to connect to your mud, open your mud client  
(zmud, mush, mudlet, etc) and go to host: 127.0.0.1 Port 5555.  

If you wish to modify the mud, open your browser ( firefox, chrome.opera, etc)  
and navigate to ports 80 or 27744 ( public), or the (admin) web site on port 27777.  
i.e. (http://localhost:27777/)
