To Install JDK: https://ninite.com/  
When you have it all installed, make a shortcut for mud.bat  
and then you can change the name to Coffeemud, and change the icon, and  
click that to start your server.

When you want to connect to your mud, open your mud client  
(zmud, mush, mudlet, etc) and go to host: 127.0.0.1 Port 5555.
